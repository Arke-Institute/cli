# Hahnemann University Academic Affairs Records  
## Handwritten Medical Theses (1850‑1867)

---

## Overview  

The collection comprises two handwritten, bound theses submitted to the **Homeopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania** in Philadelphia as part of the requirements for the Doctor of Medicine degree. The first, *An Essay on the Use of the Obstetrical Forceps* (1850), is a concise historical survey of obstetric instruments. The second, *An Inaugural Dissertation on Philosophy of Parturition* (1867), presents a philosophical treatise on childbirth and the nature of medical knowledge. Both works illustrate the academic practices of the college—hand‑written manuscripts on uniform thesis paper with alternate blank pages—and provide insight into 19th‑century homeopathic medical education, obstetric practice, and the intellectual climate surrounding parturition.
