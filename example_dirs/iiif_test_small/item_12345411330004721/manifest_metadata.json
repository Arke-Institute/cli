As a requirement of the College, each candidate composed a thesis, or essay, in their own handwriting, on the medical subject of their choosing, in order to be considered for the degree of medicine. Essays were also required to be written on thesis paper, of a uniform size, and the alternate pages being left blank. Theses are bound by year (most of the time), however, each individual thesis has its own record. The Homeopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania was founded in 1848 to provide standardized training in the emerging system of medicine called homeopathy. In 1869 the Homeopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania and Hahnemann Medical College (founded in 1867) merged to create a new institution called Hahnemann Medical College of Philadelphia.']}",
